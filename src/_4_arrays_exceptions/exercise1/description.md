# Words that contain "AV"

Create a program that asks the user to provide a sentence as input.

After the user enters a sentence, it is split on spaces. It then prints all words containing `av`. It does not matter whether the letters occur in uppercase or lowercase.

After printing the words containing `av`, the user can enter another sentence. This continues until the user enters a blank line.

```console

java

```

Tip: You can split a String on spaces using the method `.split(" ")`.

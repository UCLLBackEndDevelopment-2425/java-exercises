# Last word

Create a program that asks the user to provide a sentence as input.

After the user enters a sentence, it is split on spaces. Then print the last word of the sentence.

After printing the last word of the sentence, the user can enter another sentence. This continues until the user enters a blank line.

```console

Tip: You can split a String on spaces using the method `.split(" ")`.

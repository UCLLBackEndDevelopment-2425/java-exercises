# Logic Error

Here’s a AreaCalculator.java program that solves for the area of different shapes:

* Triangle: area = 1/2 * base * height
* Rectangle: area = length * width
* Circle: area = π * r * r

There is a logical error: it is not calculating the areas right for one of the shapes. Find the bug!

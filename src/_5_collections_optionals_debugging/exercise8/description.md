# Phone Book

In this exercise, we are going to write classes to build a simple old phone book application.
With a phone book it is easily to look up the phone number of a given person based on its name.
An on the other hand it is easily to look up the name of the person with a given phone number.

Create the right classes and methods and use Optionals and its methods at the right places in your implementation.
Throw the right exceptions when no person or no phone number is found given a phone number or a person's name.

Use the right type of collection to store some hard coded data in and use it to test your application.
